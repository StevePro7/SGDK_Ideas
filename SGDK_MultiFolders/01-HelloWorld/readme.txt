Today, I tried to replicate a stripped down version of the SGDK makefile
i.e.
~/dev/makefile.gen


Here are the assumptions for this to work:

01.
copy under "src" the "boot" folder with 2x files from here
E:\SGDK\src\boot


02.
manually create the "out" directory and the 2x sub directories
res
src
