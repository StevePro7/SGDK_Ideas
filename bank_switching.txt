Bank switching
18/10/2019

Initially sounds like did not want to support bank switching as per this forum
http://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14&start=765


But if you check the latest master which I have used to build library
there seems to be support in the mapper.h file

e.g.

SYS_getBank
SYS_setBank
